                <p>"The Eiffel Tower is a famous Parisian landmark, built in 1889 for the World’s Fair. Designed by Gustave Eiffel, it stands 324 meters tall and offers stunning views of Paris. Known for its iron lattice structure, it’s a symbol of French culture and a major tourist attraction."</p>

                <h3>Louvre Museum</h3>
                <p>The Louvre Museum, located in Paris, France, is one of the world's largest and most visited art museums. Originally built as a fortress in the late 12th century, it was transformed into a royal palace and eventually opened as a museum in 1793. The Louvre is renowned for its vast collection of art and historical artifacts, including iconic works like Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" and the ancient Greek statue "Venus de Milo." Its glass pyramid entrance, designed by architect I. M. Pei, is a modern addition that contrasts with the museum's historic architecture.</p>
